                        <p>I'm a 25 years old young man from Portugal who's on a path to change my career and become a software developer.
                            <br>I'm specially motivated by the working conditions of it , to have a flexible schedule and be able to work anywhere at anytime, to be more present for my family and of course to be able to provide more effectively in my household.
                            <br>I've been having good examples and assistance from other devs that already work in the area such as Murilo and the DevEmDobro twins. 
                        </p>

                        <p>Murilo has been a good friend for a few years now, He's from Brazil but living in Portugal and we met at a job we both didn't really aspired to go on for a lifetime. He was the first of us to enrol on the path i'm on , so he studied hard to become a dev ASAP through a technical course and a lot of self-taught as well. He got in IT through QA tester position at Capgemini a well known multinational company. He's now taking a technical degree in Systems Analysis & Development to upgrade his skills and opportunities.
                        
                        <br><br>Murilo as been a great motivator and an inspiration for me , he never gets tired of helping me and providing usefull insights on how should I progress on this path, that's why I included him in this page to honor and payback respects to him! 
                        Thank you for everything my good friend!</p>

                        <h3>Dev em Dobro</h3>
                        <p>Software Developers, E-learning Providers</p>
                        <p>Ricardo and Roberto Dias are the twins behind the company Dev em Dobro. They are from Brazil and they have been working as Devs for a long time now.
                        <br>They created Dev em Dobro to help people from any professional background or age and teach them the skills and insights they need to get into the same career successfully in the shortest period of time.
                        <br>I found them through Instagram and enrolled on a 7 day immersive Front End project. That's how i got into Web Dev studying because prior to that I was studying only python automation , which is a useful skill of course but I couldn't see a quick and successful path through it at the moment. After the 7 day project with them i started studying on my own and have been now able to complete my own little projects to add on my portfolio.
                        They also have a more extensive course on Fullstack Development in which I intend to enrol next.
